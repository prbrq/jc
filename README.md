# jc

## Installation

### I just want to try

Good. You can use it like this `./jc foo.json bar.json`.

### I want to install

Awesome. Well, let's do it.

1) Clone the repository into a folder that is convenient for you (for me it's `~/Projects/jc`) like this `git clone https://github.com/prbrq/jc.git ~/Projects/jc`
2) `mkdir -p ~/.bin`
3) `ln -s "$HOME/Projects/jc/jc" "$HOME/.bin/jc"`
4) `export PATH="$HOME/.bin:$PATH"`
